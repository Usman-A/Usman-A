## Hey there! <img src="./assets/GIFS/waving.gif" width="25px">

My name is Usman Asad and I am a Canadian Computer Science student at McMaster University. I am currently in the last year of my undergrad and I've loved every moment of it! I love learning all about technology and engineering. Just seeing our civilization improve year to year with modern-day engineering makes me excited to see what the future holds for us. I really wish to contribute to that future in someway or another with my work. Another thing that I am passionate about is cars/automobiles and one day I hope that I can leverage my software engineering knowledge and use that to work at such a company. I am experienced with OOP, cloud architecture, algorithms, and database design/modeling.
